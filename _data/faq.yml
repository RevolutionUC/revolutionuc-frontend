- q: What is a hackathon?
  a: Great Question! A hackathon is an event where student hackers bring their passion for technology
     to create a new project coded from scratch. It’s a chance to collaborate and create something unique
     in any number of forms - an app, a robot, a website! You’ll hopefully learn something new along the
     way in our high energy, engaging environment! At RevolutionUC, participants are provided with opportunities
     to grow while building something they're proud of!

- q: How long does RevolutionUC last?
  a: Hacking at RevolutionUC lasts for 24 hours, however there is additional time before
     and after hacking for introductions and presentations.

- q: How much does RevolutionUC cost?
  a: RevolutionUC is free for all students enrolled at any accredited university or high school.
     Meals, refreshments, snacks, swag, prizes, and great memories are all included with this completely free cost!

- q: How do teams register?
  a: Teams are formed at the event. If you already have a team, please make sure every individual in
     your team is registered before the event! The maximum team size is 4.

- q: What if I don’t have a team?
  a: That's okay! After the opening ceremony, we hold a networking and brainstorming session
     to help you find a team and/or project.

- q: What if I don’t have much experience?
  a: You’re new to hackathons? Wonderful! RevolutionUC is open to all skill levels,
     beginners to veterans. There’s nothing we love more than helping our hackers
     learn something new while they build something cool!

- q: Will there be meals, snacks, or refreshments?
  a: Of course! We know our hackers will be busy working so we will have free meals,
     snacks, and refreshments to keep you running through the night.

- q: Should I expect a waiver?
  a: You betcha. Before any hacking begins we require you to sign a waiver which will be
     emailed to all registered participants prior  to the hackathon. If you are under 18
     you will need a parent or legal guardian to sign the waiver.

- q: Is there a minimum age for participants?
  a: No, all coders are invited! But if you're under 18, you will need to have a
     parent/guardian sign the waiver.

- q: Where at the University of Cincinnati is the hackathon?
  a: The hackerspace is located in [Rhodes Hall](https://www.uc.edu/content/dam/common/docs/maps/campus_map_west.pdf).
     Look out for an email before the hackathon for specific rooms and where to go when you arrive on campus.

- q: Where do I park?
  a: UC has plenty of parking garages! For a full list, check out UC’s [Maps and Visitor Info page]
     (https://www.uc.edu/parking/visitors-maps.html). The hackathon occurs on West Campus, so we would
     recommend parking at [Woodside Garage](https://www.uc.edu/parking/visitors-maps.html#wa) or
     [Campus Green Garage](https://www.uc.edu/parking/visitors-maps.html#cg).

- q: What should I bring?
  a: Please bring a valid school ID for registration, a computer to hack on, any chargers for your device(s),
     and a positive attitude. We also recommend bringing basic toiletries (toothbrush, deodorant, etc),
     a pillow/blanket (if you choose to nap). Please note that Ethernet access will be limited, so please plan
     to use a Wi-Fi connection.

- q: Will there be travel reimbursements?
  a: We offer carpool reimbursement on a case by case basis - receipts must be provided to receive travel
     reimbursement. We don’t offer reimbursement for flights. As a standard rule, we'll reimburse 15 cents per mile
     between UC and your school, up to $60 for a car with more than one participant, or $40 if traveling alone.
     If we have more reimbursement requests than anticipated, we'll drop the per mile rate fairly
     to accomodate all reimbursement applicants. You'll be able to apply for travel reimbursement 
     following the event. If you’d like more information please do not
     hesitate to email us at [info@revolutionuc.com](mailto:info@revolutionuc.com).

- q: What if I have more questions?
  a: We will have organizers and volunteers present, so don't be shy and ask away! Feel free to tweet
     at us at [@Revolution_UC](http://www.twitter.com/Revolution_UC) with the hashtag \#AskRevUC or
     send an email to [info@revolutionuc.com](mailto:info@revolutionuc.com).

- q: Is there a Code of Conduct?
  a: Absolutely! We operate on the [Major League Hacking Code of Conduct](https://static.mlh.io/docs/mlh-code-of-conduct.pdf)
     to create an all-inclusive environment for our hackers.
