- q: What is a hackathon?
  a: Great Question! A hackathon is an event where student hackers bring their passion for technology
     to create a new project coded from scratch. It’s a chance to collaborate and create something unique
     in any number of forms - an app, a robot, a website! You’ll hopefully learn something new along the
     way in our high energy, engaging environment! At RevolutionUC, participants are provided with opportunities
     to grow while building something they're proud of!

# - q: Will RevolutionUC be in-person?
#   a: Nope! This year, we will be hosting the entire hackathon virtually! We want to make sure our participants
#      stay safe, as well as abide by state mandates on large events. The good news is anyone anywhere can participate
#      since you don’t need to travel to the University of Cincinnati!

# - q: How will I access RevolutionUC virtually?
#   a: We will be using a Discord server to encourage communication during the event. Some events like workshops may be held on Cisco Webex.

- q: How long does RevolutionUC last?
  a: Hacking at RevolutionUC lasts for 24 hours, however there is additional time before
     and after hacking for introductions and presentations.

- q: How much does RevolutionUC cost?
  a: RevolutionUC is free for all students enrolled at any accredited university or high school. Swag, prizes, and
     great memories are all included with this completely free cost!

- q: How do teams register?
  a: Teams are formed at the event. If you already have a team, please make sure every individual in
     your team is registered before the event! The maximum team size is 4.

- q: What if I don’t have a team?
  a: That’s okay! Using [Lattice](https://lattice.revolutionuc.com/) will assist you in looking for team members that you want in 
    your team.

- q: What if I don’t have much experience?
  a: You’re new to hackathons? Wonderful! RevolutionUC is open to all skill levels,
     beginners to veterans. There’s nothing we love more than helping our hackers
     learn something new while they build something cool!

# - q: Will there be meals, snacks, or refreshments?
#   a: Since we are hosting RevolutionUC completely virtual, we are not able to provide refreshments.

# - q: Will any hardware or software be provided?
#   a: This year, we will only be able to provide software through MLH.

- q: Should I expect a waiver?
  a: You betcha. Before any hacking begins we require you to sign a waiver which will be
     emailed to all registered participants prior  to the hackathon. If you are under 18
     you will need a parent or legal guardian to sign the waiver.

- q: Is there a minimum age for participants?
  a: Yes, all coders must be at least 16 years of age! If you're under 18, you will need to have a
     parent/guardian sign the waiver.

- q: Where is the hackathon?
  a: This year we will be completely in-person! We hope to give you the best hackathon experience at the
     <a href="https://innovation.uc.edu" target="_blank">1819 Innovation Hub</a> of University of Cincinnati, located at
     2900 Reading Rd, Cincinnati, OH 45206.
  
# - q: What should I prepare?
#   a: A comfortable place to hack with a good internet connection! During the registration process, we will ask
#      you to send a scan of your school ID and sign a waiver.

# - q: Where do I park?
#   a: UC has plenty of parking garages! For a full list, check out UC’s 
#      [Maps and Visitor Info page](https://www.uc.edu/parking/visitors-maps.html). 
#      The hackathon occurs on West Campus, so we would recommend parking at 
#      [Woodside Garage](https://www.uc.edu/parking/visitors-maps.html#wa) or
#      [Campus Green Garage](https://www.uc.edu/parking/visitors-maps.html#cg).

- q: What should I bring?
  a: Please bring a valid school ID for registration, a computer to hack on, any chargers for your device(s),
     and a positive attitude. We also recommend bringing basic toiletries (toothbrush, deodorant, etc),
     a pillow/blanket (if you choose to nap). Please note that Ethernet access will be limited, so please plan
     to use a Wi-Fi connection.

- q: Will there be travel reimbursements?
  a: Unfortunately, we are unable to offer travel reimbursements at this time.
#   a: We offer carpool reimbursement on a case by case basis - receipts must be provided to receive travel
#      reimbursement. We don’t offer reimbursement for flights. As a standard rule, we'll reimburse 15 cents per mile
#      between UC and your school, up to $60 for a car with more than one participant, or $40 if traveling alone.
#      If we have more reimbursement requests than anticipated, we'll drop the per mile rate fairly
#      to accommodate all reimbursement applicants. You'll be able to apply for travel reimbursement 
#      following the event. If you’d like more information please do not
#      hesitate to email us at [info@revolutionuc.com](mailto:info@revolutionuc.com).

# - q: What if I can't make it on time?
#   a: That's okay! If you arrive before 1:30 PM on Saturday, you can still check-in inside Rhodes Hall.
#      If you arrive after 1:30 PM on Saturday, you can check-in near the Hackerspace in the 8th floor Rhodes Lobby.

- q: What if I have more questions?
  a: Send us an email to info@revolutionuc.com. We are always happy to help.

- q: Is there a Code of Conduct?
  a: Absolutely! We operate on the [Major League Hacking Code of Conduct](https://static.mlh.io/docs/mlh-code-of-conduct.pdf)
     to create an all-inclusive environment for our hackers.
