            If you have attended any hackathons in the past, then you know how
            much time it takes to get a project started: decide on what to
            build, pick a programming language, pick a web framework, pick a
            styling framework. A while later, you might have an initial project
            up on GitHub and only then can other team members start
            contributing.
          </p>
          <p>
            The primary focus is on simplicity and ease of use. The owner of
            this project also tried to make it as generic and reusable as
            possible to cover most use cases of hackathon web apps, without
            being too specific.

        <div class="accordion__content">
          <p>
            A massive open online course (MOOC) is an online course aimed at
            unlimited participation and open access via the web. In addition to
            traditional course materials, such as filmed lectures, readings, and
            problem sets, many MOOCs provide interactive courses with user
            forums or social media discussions to support community interactions
            among students, professors, and teaching assistants (TAs), as well
            as immediate feedback to quick quizzes and assignments.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Note:&nbsp;</strong>MOOCs are great for learning. However,
            be careful to not submit code from the tutorials/courses. MOOCs
            should be used solely for learning. <br />
