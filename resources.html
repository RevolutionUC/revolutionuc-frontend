                  If you have attended any hackathons in the past, then you know how much time it takes to get a
                  project started:
                  decide on what to build, pick a programming language, pick a web framework, pick a styling framework. A
                  while later,
                  you might have an initial project up on GitHub and only then can other team members start
                  contributing.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The primary focus is on simplicity and ease of use. The owner of this project also tried to make it
                  as generic and reusable
                  as possible to cover most use cases of hackathon web apps, without being too specific.

                  A massive open online course (MOOC) is an online course aimed at unlimited participation and open
                  access via the web.
                  In addition to traditional course materials, such as filmed lectures, readings, and problem sets,
                  many MOOCs provide
                  interactive courses with user forums or social media discussions to support community interactions
                  among students,
                  professors, and teaching assistants (TAs), as well as immediate feedback to quick quizzes and
                  assignments.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Note:&nbsp;</strong>MOOCs are great for learning. However, be careful to not submit code 
                  from the tutorials/courses. MOOCs should be used solely for learning.
